			"text": "<br>Different situations may require Unshielded Twisted pair (UTP)/STP cables to be wired according to different wiring conventions. This means that the individual wires in the cable have to be connected in different orders to different sets of pins in the RJ-45 connectors. The following are main cable types that are obtained by using specific wiring conventions:<br>1. Ethernet Straight-through<br>2. Ethernet Crossover"

This is a common error in the lab and checking that the device connections are correct should be the first troubleshooting action if connectivity is not achieved. "
