The most common link state protocol is OSPF, or Open Shortest Path First.<br><br>In terms of exterior gateway protocols, there is only one in use today. The entire Internet needs to agree on how to exchange this sort of information, so a single standard has emerged. This standard is known as BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol."
